## About dataset

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to [iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

Dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

### My model

Models train perfectly on this dataset. Their accuracy is great. For this reason, I decided to challenge myself and I trained models on possibly small number of observations.
